## What the heck is Network?

## Networks of Many Sizes

Of the size, idk how to define it, there should no be a strict definition of the size of a network. You can say more than 300 devices is a small or even large network, that should not be the no absolute definition of the size of a network. But, we can still have a rough idea of the size of a network. here are some examples:

### Small Home / Office Networks

1. Typically involve a few devices (e.g., computers, printers, smartphones).

2. Often use a single router or switch to connect devices.

3. Network management is relatively simple and often handled by a single individual.

### Medium to Large Networks

1. Include more devices, potentially spanning multiple floors or buildings.

2. May require multiple routers, switches, and access points to manage network traffic.

3. Often involve more complex network management, including VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and network segmentation.

### World Wide Network

1. Refers to the global network infrastructure, including the Internet.

2. Consists of a vast number of interconnected networks (ISPs, data centers, etc.).

3. Requires sophisticated protocols and systems to manage data traffic and connectivity on a global scale.

## Clients and Servers

In a network, **people (clients)** are like individuals who need access to various rooms (servers). They knock on doors (send requests) to enter these rooms and obtain the resources or services they require. 

For instance, when someone uses a web browser to visit a website or checks their email, they are acting as clients. On the other hand, **rooms (servers)** are like spaces that offer resources or services. These rooms have doors (ports) that open in response to requests from people (clients). 

When a request is made, the room provides the necessary information or service. However, if a room (server) receives too many requests at once—meaning many people are trying to enter simultaneously—it can become overwhelmed. Just like a room that is overcrowded might slow down or even be unable to accommodate more people, a server under heavy load may respond slowly or fail to provide the requested services altogether.

## Peer-to-Peer networks

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking is like a group chat in messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. In a P2P network, every participant (or peer) can act both as a client and a server. This means that every person in the group chat has their own `room` (server) and can share resources or information directly with others without needing a central authority. When you send a message, it's sent directly from your `room` to your friend's `room,` and vice versa. There isn't a central server managing all the messages

instead, every peer handles its own communication and contributes to the network. This is different from the traditional client-server model, where clients request services from a centralized server. In the P2P model, every peer is equal and helps to manage and share resources within the network.
